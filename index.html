    This tool has a client side (this web page) and a server side component. 
    The latter is triggered automatically (via <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank">gihub actions</a>) everytime a github submission is made. 
    The motivation is that domain subject researchers need a user-friendly versioned mechanism to create and manage concept IDs.
    GitHub, particulalry after adding the actions worflow functionality in the Fall of 2019, appears well placed to serve both the client and server side.
    Ultimately, the goal is that this application can be used by other organizations by simply forking this github repository.
